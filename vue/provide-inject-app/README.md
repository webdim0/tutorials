# Provide / Inject Tutorial

In this practical tutorial I made example of usage provide/inject functions in Vue3 for global application state management.

Provide and inject are new functions in Vue3, and in some simple situation can be used instead of Vuex or another more complex solutions like thet.

Chapter from native Vue documentation about this functionality is pretty simple and clear - [Provide / Inject](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-provide-inject.html), also I recommend this article with good examples - [Provide/Inject API With Vue 3](https://www.thisdot.co/blog/provide-inject-api-with-vue-3).

In my tutorial project I made two classes of stores with same functionality but different code structure for examples: UserInfoState.js and UserVehiclesState.js and two components to demonstrate the usage visually UserInfo.vue and UserVehicles.vue.
